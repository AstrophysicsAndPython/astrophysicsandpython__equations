The Schwarzschild radius (\(R_s\)) is a coordinate singularity in the solution to Einstein's field equations which separates the interior and exterior space-time of the compressed object (black hole). For the particular coordinates used by Schwarzschild in obtaining the solution, \(r = R_s\) does produce the singularity. However, this singularity can be removed if we shift to a different coordinate system.<h2>Formula</h2>Although we will not be going in details about how to derive the solution proposed by Karl Schwarzschild, we will outline the formula where the singularity appears and explain it a bit for understanding purposes.<br>Assuming a spherically symmetric and static spacetime without the presence of a cosmological constant, the space-time metric can be simplified down to,<br><br><div class="sc_form">\(ds^2 = A(r)dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2) + B(r)dt^2 \)</div><br>Note that, \(A(r)\) and \(B(r)\) are two functions that are entirely \(r\) dependant. So if, at any point, the radial element becomes 0, the metric becomes singular. Further, simplifying the expressions for \(A(r)\) and \(B(r)\) gives us,<br><br><div class="sc_expanded">\(ds^2 = \left(1 - \dfrac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2) - c^2\left(1 - \dfrac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)dt^2 \)</div><br>The expression in the parenthesis \(\dfrac{2GM}{c^2}\) is the expression for Schwarzschild radius. Rewriting the above equation,<br><br><div class="sc_final">\(ds^2 = \left(1 - \dfrac{R_s}{r}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2) - c^2\left(1 - \dfrac{R_s}{r}\right)dt^2 \)</div><br>The terms, \(\left(1 - \dfrac{R_s}{r}\right)^{-1}\) and \(\left(1 - \dfrac{R_s}{r}\right)\) becomes 0 at \(r = R_s\) and \(r = 0\) respectively thus making the above equation singular at two different points.<br><br>Now that we know about that the Schwarzschild radius can be obtained by,<br><br><div>\(R_s = \dfrac{2GM}{c^2}\)</div><h2>Calculate Schwarzschild radius from mass</h2><br><div>For an object of mass \(M\) = <input type="text" id="mass1" placeholder="M [kg]" oninput="calc_scr()"> kilogram</div><br><div>The Schwarzschild radius will be = <input type="text" id="rs1" placeholder="Rs [m]"> meters</div><h2>Calculate mass from Schwarzschild radius</h2><div>For an object with Schwarzschild radius \(R_s\) = <input type="text" id="rs2" placeholder="Rs [m]" oninput="calc_mass()"> meters,</div><br><div>The mass of the object will be = <input type="text" id="mass2" placeholder="M [kg]"> kg.</div></body></html>
